        <h2 class="Bio">Short Bio</h2>
        <p data-testid="test-user-bio">
          I didn’t study anything related to computer science at university. I
          actually studied Mass Communication but along the way, I developed a
          deep interest in technology and web development. That curiosity led me
          to learn and also transitioned to frontend development, where I now
          enjoy building responsive, accessible, and user-friendly web
          experiences with React, TypeScript, and SCSS.

        <p data-testid="test-user-time">
          Through the HNG Internship, I aim to sharpen my frontend development
          skills by working on real-world projects and collaborating with
          talented developers. I want to improve my problem-solving abilities,
          learn best practices for teamwork and version control, and gain
          hands-on experience that prepares me for professional opportunities in
          tech. My ultimate goal is to grow into a well-rounded engineer who can
          build scalable, high-quality web applications.

        <p>
          You didn’t start with a tech background, but you chose to learn, grow,
          and build anyway and that choice matters more than where you began.
          Stay curious, stay consistent, and remember that every line of code
          you write is proof that you’re becoming the person you once hoped to
          be. Keep going, you’re on the right path.
